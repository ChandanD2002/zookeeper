# zookeeper
## This project displays my ability to showcase my knowledge on Express.js.
### The local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked me to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called "Zoo Keepr". This site’s data will be stored on the server I've created. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.
